The analysis was broken into the following steps.

First the raw datasets from the website ANALYZE BOSTON were cleaned of any missing values and then combined into a single dataset from 2015 to 2023. The data was then processed to get rid of any crimes that would not add value to the analysis.
The new dataset was then stored as the Processed_data.csv in the Data folder.

This processed dataset was then used for further analysis which included splitting the crimes into a tier list based on crime severity and each crime tier and crime type was analyzed.
The analysis steps included exploratory data analysis to understand how the crime has developed over the years and what effect did major world incidents like the COVID-19 lockdown have on certain crimes.

Further, forecasting analysis was performed for each crime type to predict the crime rates in the year 2024.
